Justice Chukwuma Assignment 3

I contributed everything to this assignment. I don't have a partner. Therefore,
I coded up all the HTML templates and the design of the website. I also
modified the behavior of the database code (database.py) from Assignment 2 so
that it easily integrated with this assignment and passed the necessary errors
to my penny.py file. I also did all the debugging myself.

I had asked Anat during office hours how to get the same design as the form on
the reference homepage because my labels and text inputs were not aligning
correctly. She suggested that I look up tables, and that hint allowed me to get
the same design as the reference. I had also asked Anat about the nuance of
using Jinja. She also helped me figure out why my database.py wasn't returning
the exception that I had wanted. The TA Lisa Liu helped me realize why my
cookies weren't working -- I unfortunately was using request.args.get(), rather
than request.cookies.get().

For the completion of this assignment, I utilized office hours, the lecture
handouts, and posts on Ed Discussions.

I spent about 20 hours on this assignment.

This assignment helped me learn how the user is sent from one page to another
on the backend. It allowed me to break down a website to its structure, and I
found that very exciting. I also received a good understanding of cookies and
finally how to catch errors thrown from a different file.

The reason why my assignment is late is because I was trying to implement the
cookies feature. Turns out, I was using request.args.get(), rather than
request.cookies.get(). I think I missed this all day on Sunday because I was
sleep deprived from getting a few hours of sleep and taking a midterm earlier
that day at 9:30am.
